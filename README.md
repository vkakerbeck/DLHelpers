# DLHelpers
 *Written by Viviane Kakerbeck*
 
This is a little collection of deep learning helper functions. I try to write then as universal as possible such that anyone can use them 
as help when doing deep learning. 
 
## Implemented so far:
- BatchCreator: Helper function that extracts columns from csv files and returns them in form of batches.
